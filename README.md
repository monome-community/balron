**Long description:**

Balron maps 8-tone scales across the 40h grid, turning the 40h into a very compact midi controller.

* multiple scales in a drop-down menu, with key and transposition settings
* four bpm synced midi delays with time from unison to 8 measures
* cell shift transposition on each delay
* velocity setting for original and each midi delay
* global release time extends played notes by specified ms
* local clock or external sync
